intro:
  - excerpt: "I am a vision scientist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley.
    I'm interested in stereovision and motion perception, with a focus on computational modeling and psychophysics.

    I did my PhD work at University of California, Davis under the supervision of Ken Britten, where I investigated how
    the visual system extracts information about heading from the retinal images during smooth pursuit eye movements.
    I have an undergraduate degree in physiology with a minor in Neuroscience from McGill University in Montreal, QC, Canada."
