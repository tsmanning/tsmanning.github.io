      <p>[Test5] I am a vision scientist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Berkeley
      under the supervision of <a href="http://www.emilyacooper.org/">Dr. Emily A. Cooper</a>. I'm interested in stereovision and
      motion perception, with a focus on computational modeling and psychophysics.</p>

      <p>I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at University of California, Davis under the supervision of
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7pLcIR8AAAAJ">Dr. Kenneth H. Britten</a>, where I investigated how the visual system extracts
      information about heading from the retinal images during smooth pursuit eye movements using non-human primate models.</p>

      <p>I have an undergraduate degree in physiology with a minor in Neuroscience from
      McGill University in Montreal, QC, Canada. During my undergrad studies, I worked as a research associate under the supervision
      of Dr. Petra Schweinhardt investigating the neurocorrelates of cortical reorganization and dysfunction in individuals with
      chronic pain syndromes.</p>
