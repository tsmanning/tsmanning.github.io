# Reviews and lectures
- I wrote a [brief review](https://tsmanning.github.io/files/Manning_Britten.2017.pdf) of visual motion processing in primates with Ken Britten a few years back.
- I put together a [lecture](https://tsmanning.github.io/files/MotionContrast.pdf) on motion and contrast and their relation to neurophysiology and perception that might be helpful for people just dipping their toes into systems neuro.

# Vision + perception
- Michael Bach's illusion [website](https://michaelbach.de/ot/)
- Clif Schor's Oculomotor [website](http://schorlab.berkeley.edu/passpro/oculomotor/default.html)

# Neuroscience
- Neuromatch [academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/): great resources for computational neuroscience and deep learning
- Anne's list: [list](https://anneslist.net/) of female systems neuroscientists
- [Spikes](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262181747/spikes/): great computational neuroscience reference
- Green & Swets' Signal Detection Theory [classic](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1967-02286-000)
- Dayan & Abbot's [Theoretical Neuroscience](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262041997/theoretical-neuroscience/)

# Open Source Software
I try to use open source software whenever possible. Here's a bunch of applications I've come to know and love:
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (vector graphics software)
- [OpenBoard](https://openboard.ch/index.en.html) (virtual whiteboard - great with Zoom + Wacom!)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (library manager)
  - I also use [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) and [Zutilo](https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md) to organize my linked file library so each PDF is renamed sensibly. Works great for syncing with a cloud library.
  - To keep my library accessible on other devices (smartphone, tablet) I use [Zoo for Zotero](https://github.com/mickstar/Zoo-For-Zotero) and rclone to sync the library with GDrive.
  - Guide to set up the whole ecosystem [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325828616_Tutorial_The_Best_Reference_Manager_Setup_Zotero_ZotFile_Cloud_Storage)!
- [Function Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keuwl.functiongenerator&hl=en_US&gl=US) (Android app) - Generates pure tones with smartphone speaker
- [Spectrum Analyze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raspw.SpectrumAnalyze&hl=en_US&gl=US) (Android app) - Runs FFT and visualizes mic input. Super helpful working with ephys noise!
- [CVSimulator](http://asada.website/cvsimulator/e/) (Android app) - Easy to use color blindness simulator
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (Web app) - Great way to collaborative write and visualize LaTeX docs
